# GymsEra — Agent Handoff (live state)

**This file is the shared memory between AI agents** (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex, Cursor, or a human).
Whichever agent works next reads this first and continues from **Next action**. No agent may rely on
its own chat history or its tool's built-in memory: if it isn't written here, in spec §13, or in git, the
next agent won't know it.

- Permanent rules: `AGENTS.md` in each repo.
- Master spec: `GYMSERA_PRODUCTION_ARCHITECTURE.md` (this folder). §13 holds finished work; §14 holds owner decisions.
- Prompts in order: `GYMSERA_AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md` (this folder).

## 1. Current position

<!-- The active agent overwrites this whole section at every checkpoint. Keep it short and exact. -->

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last updated | 2026-09-27 |
| Updated by | Claude Code (Opus 5.5) |
| Current prompt | **Prompt 1A — Billing core (BILL-12, BILL-02, BILL-06, BILL-01, BILL-14)** |
| Prompt status | `IN PROGRESS` <!-- NOT STARTED / IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED ON OWNER / DONE --> |
| Issue in progress | BILL-12 |
| Step within issue | verify done; fix in progress <!-- verify / root cause / test written (red) / fix / test green / §13 row / committed --> |

### Branches and last commits

| Repo | Branch | Last commit (hash + subject) | Uncommitted changes? |
|---|---|---|---|
| gyms_era | `phase-1/prompt-1a-billing-core` (from master 11d37b1) | 11d37b1 gbfgb | no |
| gymsera_be | `phase-1/prompt-1a-billing-core` (from main 6bf60e7) | 6bf60e7 jhvjvjhv | only this handoff file |
| gymsera_cms | main | 4c631b1 test(cms): add Playwright login smoke test and CI workflow | no |
| gymsera_web | `phase-1/prompt-1a-billing-core` (from main f84b784) | f84b784 test(web): add Playwright login smoke test and CI workflow | no |

### Next action (exact, so another agent can do it without guessing)

> BILL-12: build the `billing_events` inbox (platform migration runner with --dry-run, reusing
> `runTenantMigrations` with a platform migration list), make every webhook insert-then-process, refetch provider
> truth, and route webhooks + /sync through one shared apply function
> (`subscription-migration.service.js#applyVerifiedSubscription`). Then BILL-02, BILL-06, BILL-01, BILL-14 in order.

### Work in progress that is NOT committed

- (none yet)

### Blocked / waiting on the owner

- (none)

## 2. Done in the current prompt (checklist)

<!-- Copy the issue list of the current prompt here when you start it. Tick items as they are committed. -->

Verification (all five reproduced in code, 2026-09-27): see §12.13.1 rows; BILL-14 entitlement already safe, UX part confirmed.

- [ ] 1. BILL-12 — webhook inbox, refetch truth, one apply path
- [ ] 2. BILL-02 — REVOKED state, refunds from all three providers end entitlement via reconcileCapacity
- [ ] 3. BILL-06 — server-side Android acknowledge inside the verified sync path, retried through the inbox
- [ ] 4. BILL-01 — purchase bound to one tenant (409 subscription_owned_by_other_account), unique index, mobile sends tenant id
- [ ] 5. BILL-14 — Stripe return page verifies the session server-side

(Previous prompt's checklist, Step 2.10/2.10b/NEW-17, is complete and recorded in spec §13.)

## 3. Notes for the next agent

<!-- Things you learned that are not obvious from the code or §13: commands that work, test DB setup quirks,
     files that look relevant but aren't, dead ends already tried. Append; delete only when no longer true. -->

- **Exact commands to run each test suite:**
  - `gymsera_be`:
    - Command: `npm test`
    - Cwd: `/Users/powertech/Developer/Apps/InovettaTech/SaaS/gymsera_be`
    - Runs isolated test DBs (`gymsera_test_platform`, `gymsera_test_tenant_1`, `gymsera_test_tenant_2`) on local MySQL 5.7 (port 3308 locally via `gymsera-test-mysql57` docker container, 3306 in CI). Never touches live or staging DBs (R-19).
    - Status: ALL 12 suites PASS, 51 tests PASS. Zero failures.
  - `gyms_era` (Flutter):
    - Command: `flutter test test/regression/`
    - Cwd: `/Users/powertech/Developer/Apps/InovettaTech/SaaS/GymsEraApp/gyms_era`
    - Status: 4 suites PASS (5 tests total: §9.2, §9.3, §9.5, §9.8).
    - Note on `flutter test`: runs all tests; all 5 regression tests pass, but `test/widget_test.dart` ("Counter increments smoke test") fails because it is the unused Flutter default template counter test.
  - `gymsera_cms`:
    - Unit/Component: `npm test` (runs Vitest jsdom tests in `tests/`) -> PASS (2/2)
    - E2E: `npx playwright test` (runs against local port 3001) -> PASS (1/1)
  - `gymsera_web`:
    - Unit/Component: `npm test` (runs Vitest jsdom tests in `tests/`) -> PASS (2/2)
    - E2E: `npx playwright test` (runs against local port 3002) -> PASS (1/1)
- Local MySQL port is 3308 for MySQL 5.7 container (`gymsera-test-mysql57`), fallback 3306.
- Test safety guard: `tests/harness/test-db.js` exports `assertTestEnvironmentSafety` which enforces `NODE_ENV === 'test'`, DB hosts within `{localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, mysql}`, and DB names starting with `gymsera_test_`.
- Tenant migrations: `src/database/tenant-migration-runner.js` manages versioned tenant DB migrations (target version 7). To preview across all active tenants, use `node src/scripts/run-tenant-migrations.js --dry-run`. To apply, use `node src/scripts/run-tenant-migrations.js`.
